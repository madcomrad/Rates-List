# Rates-List
Android Test Application

You should implement one screen with a list of currencies. Link to designs in figma:

The app must download and update rates every 1 second using API
https://hiring.revolut.codes/api/android/latest?base=EUR

List all currencies you get from the endpoint (one per row). Each row has an input where you can enter any amount of money. When you tap on a currency row it should slide to the top and it's input becomes the first responder. When youâ€™re changing the amount the app must simultaneously update the corresponding value for other currencies.

Use any libraries and languages(java/kotlin) you want. Please, note that the solution should be production ready.

Unfortunately, we do not provide the full list of full currency names and icons, but you are welcome to use flags from the Internet or emojis instead.
